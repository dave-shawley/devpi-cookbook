devpi Cookbook
==============
This cookbook installs and configures a devpi server.  [Devpi][1] is a
PyPI-compatible Python Index server that acts as both a freestanding
Python Index as well as a pull-through cache of the official Python
Package Index.

Usage
-----
Include recipes from this cookbook to install the [devpi server][1] as
a daemon and, optionally, expose the server via an nginx endpoint.  This
cookbook supports a few different use cases.

1. Install devpi without additional support.
2. Manage devpi with either supervisor or runit.
3. Expose an installed devpi instance using nginx.

The first use case is easy, add the [devpi::server](#devpiserver) recipe
to your `run_list`.  The second use case is simple as well.  Include the
appropriate recipe and it will install devpi and configure it to run in
the chosen environment.  The final use case requires that you choose how
you want devpi to run by selecting one of the other recipes and adding it
to the node's `run_list` **before** you include [devpi::nginx](#devpinginx).

The other use case that this cookbook supports is installing and managing
a devpi-server installation.  The [devpi::client](#devpiclient) recipe
will install the `devpi` command line client into a specific virtual
environment.

### Recipes

#### devpi::server
Include this recipe in the `run_list` to install the devpi server.  It
will also create the daemon user and administrative group if necessary.

#### devpi::supervisor
Include this recipe to manage the devpi server using [supervisor][2].
It will install supervisor globally if necessary and add the devpi server
job.  This recipe assumes that the *server* recipe is already present in
the run list.

#### devpi::runit
Include this recipe to manage the devpi server using a [runit][3] script.
It will install runit globally if necessary and configure a devpi server
job.

#### devpi::nginx
Include this recipe to expose the devpi-server using [nginx][4] as a
front-end server.

#### devpi::client
Include this recipe to install the devpi command-line client.  This will
create a workstation from which you can manage a devpi-server installation.

Contributing
------------

1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a feature branch named *"feature/my_feature"* from `development`
3. Edit *README.md* to describe your feature
4. Write integration tests that verify your feature, run them with
   `rake integration-test` -- **they should fail**
5. Implement your feature in its default configuration.  You should not
   modify anything outside if the recipe at this point.  Keep iterating
   until the integration tests pass.
6. Implement unit tests to cover any configuration or platform details.
   Add attributes as needed at this point.  Run unit tests with `rake
   unit-test`.
7. Run the static analysis tasks using `rake lint`.  Fix any problems that
   they find.
8. Update *README.md* to mention any new attributes and add yourself to
   the **AUTHORS** list.
9. Issue a pull-request on Github.

*HACKING.md* contains additional details about developing in this cookbook.
