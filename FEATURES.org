#+TITLE: Cookbook Features

This file tracks features that this cookbook implements.  It is an
orgmode formatted file (see [[http://orgmode.org/]].  If you are an
emacs user, then this is right up your alley.  I'm not, but there is
a pretty nice Sublime Text plug-in for it and the format is very nice
for keeping track of TODO lists and what not.  That is precisely what
this file is -- /a list of things that need do'ing/.
